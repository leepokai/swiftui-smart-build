description: Build the Swift/SwiftUI project (build only, no auto-install)
---

**YOU MUST read the skill file first:**

```bash
cat ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/smart-build/SKILL.md
```

Then follow ONLY Steps 1-4 (build) in that skill file EXACTLY as written. Do NOT execute Steps 5-6.

This command only builds. The app will NOT auto-install when conversation ends.
