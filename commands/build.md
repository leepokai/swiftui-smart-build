description: Build the Swift/SwiftUI project (build only, no auto-install)
---

Load and follow the `smart-build` skill. YOU MUST follow every step exactly as written.

**IMPORTANT:** Only execute Steps 1-4 (build). Do NOT execute Steps 5-6 (find app, mark ready).

This command only builds. The app will NOT auto-install when conversation ends.
