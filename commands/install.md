description: Mark the last built app for auto-install when conversation ends
---

**YOU MUST read the skill file first:**

```bash
cat ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/smart-build/SKILL.md
```

Then follow ONLY Steps 5-6 (find app, mark ready) in that skill file EXACTLY as written. Skip Steps 1-4.

The app will automatically install and launch when this conversation ends.
