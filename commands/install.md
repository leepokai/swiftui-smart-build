description: Mark the last built app for auto-install when conversation ends

Load and follow the `smart-build` skill. YOU MUST follow every step exactly as written.

**IMPORTANT:** Skip Steps 1-4 (build). Only execute Steps 5-6 (find app, mark ready for install).

The app will automatically install and launch when this conversation ends.
