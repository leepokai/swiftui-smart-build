description: Build and mark for auto-install (app launches when conversation ends)

**YOU MUST read the skill file first:**

```bash
cat ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/smart-build/SKILL.md
```

Then follow every step (1-6) in that skill file EXACTLY as written. Do NOT improvise.

The app will automatically install and launch when this conversation ends.
